# TwentyOne
Blackjack game with some minor tweaks.
In this blackjack version there is a dealer (person who shuffles and distribute cards) and only one player.  
The objective of the game is for the player to beat the dealer by generating a hand of cards whose value is higher than the 
dealer's hand without exceeding a total value of 21.  
If a value greater than 21 is generated the player wins.
Otherwise whoever (player or dealer) has the hand with the highest value will win the game.  

Bust: player or dealer cards' value exceeds 21.
Blackjack: Hand of cards we have an Ace("1") and "10" or a face card.  
"1" (Ace) could be worth either 1 or 11.
